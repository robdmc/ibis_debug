The versions of code I'm using in production are basically those pinned in the requirments file in the project.  This is actually analysis code, so \"production\" in this case means running on mac os with conda/pip as package manager and connecting to postgresapp running on localhost.  I worry this might be part of the reason I can't reproduce in this container."
